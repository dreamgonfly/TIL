# Ice Lake

Ice Lake is Intel's codename for the **10th generation Intel Core processors** based on the new **Sunny Cove microarchitecture**. Ice Lake is expected to replace the Coffee Lake, Whiskey Lake, Kaby Lake and Cannon Lake microarchitectures in 2019 and 2020, representing the **architecture step** in Intel's Process-Architecture-Optimization model. Ice Lake will be produced on the second generation of Intel's 10 nm process, 10 nm+, becoming Intel's second microarchitecture to be manufactured on the 10 nm process.
