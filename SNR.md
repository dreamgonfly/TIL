# SNR

**Signal-to-noise ratio** (abbreviated **SNR** or **S/N**) is a measure that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.

$$\text{SNR} = \frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}}$$

## Decibels

Signals are often expressed using the logarithmic decibel scale. Based upon the definition of decibel, signal and noise may be expressed in decibels (dB) as

$$\text{SNR}_{dB} = 10\log_{10}(\text{SNR})$$
