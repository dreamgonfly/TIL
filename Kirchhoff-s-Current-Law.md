# Kirchhoff’s Current Law

**Gustav Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)** is one of the fundamental laws used for circuit analysis. His current law states that for a parallel path **the total current entering a circuits junction is exactly equal to the total current leaving the same junction**. This is because it has no other place to go as no charge is lost.

In other words the algebraic sum of ALL the currents entering and leaving a junction must be equal to zero as:

$$\sum I_{\text{IN}} = \sum I_{\text{OUT}}.$$

# Conservation of Charge

This idea by Kirchhoff is commonly known as the **Conservation of Charge**, as the current is conserved around the junction with no loss of current.
