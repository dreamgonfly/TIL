# TDP

TDP (**Thermal Design Power**) is the amount of heat a component is expected to output when under load.

# Summary

TDP provides solid grounds to design a cooling system around it, as well as a rough idea as to how much output a power supply unit (PSU) will need to have.

A CPU with higher TDP will usually provide more in terms of performance, but will draw more electricity from the PSU. TDP is not — however — a direct measure of how much power a component will draw, but it can be a good indicator.
