# Lombard effect

The **Lombard effect** or **Lombard reflex** is the involuntary tendency of speakers to increase their vocal effort when speaking in loud noise to enhance the audibility of their voice. This change includes not only loudness but also other acoustic features such as pitch, rate, and duration of syllables.

# Lombard speech

The collection of related vocal adjustments in response to noise is collectively referred to as ‘Lombard speech’ in humans.

# Impact to noise masking

Listeners hear a speech recorded with background noise better than they hear a speech which has been recorded in quiet with masking noise applied afterwards.

# Variations

in human speech, vowels are more likely to be elongated in Lombard speech, while consonants usually are not. In humans, males tend to exhibit a more dramatic Lombard effect than females do, and speakers in general have stronger Lombard effect-related vocal changes when they are involved in communicative interactions than when they are simply reading or speaking in a non-communicative context

# Is it a reflex?

Although the adjustment of vocal intensity happens involuntarily when background noise levels change, the phenomenon is not truly a reflex.

it is not controlled by a simple reflex arc. One clue that higher cortical areas are involved is
that the effect, although involuntary, can be modulated by social context and can be inhibited with training involving feedback from a different sensory modality. Although the Lombard effect is robust and simply instructing speakers to keep their voice level constant does little to inhibit it, when speakers are provided with visual feedback displaying their vocal intensity in real time, it is possible to train a speaker to inhibit the rise in voice amplitude.
