# Angular frequency

The **angular frequency**, ω, of an object undergoing periodic motion, such as a ball at the end of a rope being swung around in a circle, measures the rate at which the ball sweeps through a full 360 degrees, or 2π radians. **Angular frequency** is also referred to by the terms **angular speed**, **radial frequency**, **circular frequency**, **orbital frequency**, **radian frequency**, **pulsatance,** and **각진동수.**

# Period, frequency, and angular frequency

To fully understand this quantity, it helps to start with a more natural quantity, period, and work backwards. The period (*T*) of an oscillating object is the amount of time it takes to complete one oscillation. For example, there are 365 days in a year because that is how long it takes for the Earth to travel around the Sun once. This is the period for the motion of the Earth around the Sun.

But if you want to know the rate at which the rotations are occurring, you need to find the angular frequency. The frequency of rotation, or how many rotations take place in a certain amount of time, can be calculated by *f* = 1/*T*. For the Earth, one rotation takes 365 days, so *f* = 1/365 days.

So what is the angular frequency? One rotation of the Earth sweeps through 2π radians, so the angular frequency *ω* = 2π/365. In words, the Earth moves through 2π radians in 365 days.

# Unit

**T**he dimensions of this quantity are radians per unit time.

# Angular velocity

Angular frequency is a scalar quantity, meaning it is just a magnitude. However, sometimes we talk about angular velocity, which is a vector. The angular velocity formula is the same as the angular frequency equation, which determines the magnitude of the vector.
