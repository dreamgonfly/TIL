## Electric potential energy

**Electric potential energy**, or **Static potential energy**, is a potential energy associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system. An object may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements: its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged objects.

Electric potential energy is measured in joules.

## Electric potential

An **electric potential** (also called the **electric field potential**, **potential drop** or the **electrostatic potential**) is the amount of work needed to move a unit of charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration.

Electric potential is measured in joules / coulombs or volts (V).

# Voltage is another name of electric potential

Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points. The difference in electric potential between two points (i.e., voltage) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points.

## volt

1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb (of charge).
