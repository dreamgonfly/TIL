# Electric charge

The idea of charge is a framework developed to explain things like triboelectric effect. Some things have a positive charge, (it's somewhat of an arbitrary name) and some things have an opposite charge, or a negative charge. If something has a positive charge and something else has a negative charge, in our framework of charge, these two things attract each other. Opposite charges attract, and like charges repel.

If you go down to the atomic level, the nuclei of atoms are composed of protons and neutrons. The protons have a positive charge. Buzzing around the nucleus of an atom, you have electrons. The electrons have a negative charge. We can think about what's happening in terms of transfer of electrons.
