# SATA

SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is how almost everything storage related connects to your motherboard.

# Components

## Data connector

- The short, “L” shaped, seven-pin connector.
- Almost always made up of solid plastic which extends into a flat, single band cable

## Power connector

- The longer, 15-pin connector — the taller “L” of the two.
- Extend from its head to multiple, thin, rounded cables of different colors.

# Generations

- SATA was first introduced in 2000
- SATA III or 3.0 in 2008
- SATA III is the most common SATA interface used today.
- Didn’t change the physical look of the SATA connector

# Variations

- mSATA for laptop drives debuted in 2011.
- The latest generation of that technology is the M.2 standard
- SATA Express allowed for cross-compatibility with SATA III and PCIexpress drives, but wasn’t a popular choice
- eSATA offered SATA-like speeds for external drives.
    - Today, most high-speed external drives use USB 3.0 connections, commonly with the Type-C standard of connector.

# Comparisons

## vs. PATA

- SATA is a replacement of PATA.
- SATA uses a single bus to carry data unlike PATA which uses separate wires to carry data.
- Offers higher speed
- Consumes less power
- SATA wire can extend upto 1meter while PATA can extend to 40cm only.
- SATA has two connectors, one for power and other to connect data. Whereas, PATA uses a large connector with a lot of pin for data and four pin to connect power.

## vs. PCIe

- PCIe delivers greater performance.
- Higher-end desktop and laptops prefers PCIe

SATA is still an important connection standard, especially for larger hard drives and SSDs in the multi-terabyte range, but for those opting for performance, newer M.2 and NVMe drives are the go-to choice. They are more expensive, but plugging into a PCIexpress slot instead of a SATA port gives them a connection that isn’t constrained by the limits of SATA cabling and allows drives to operate at far-faster data rates. For some, as fast as gigabytes of data per second, compared with the hard SATA III limit of 600MBps.
