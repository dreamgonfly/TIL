# Power

Power is the rate at which work is done over time. Alternatively, power is the rate at which energy (U) is transferred from one place to another or transformed from one type to another over time.

$$\text{power} = \dfrac{\text{work}}{\text{time}}$$

$$\text{power} = \dfrac{\text dU}{\text dt}$$

# Unit

We measure power in units of joules/second, also known as **watts**.

1 watt = 1 joule / 1 second

# Relation to current & voltage

An electric circuit is capable of transferring power. Current is the rate of flow of charge, and voltage measures the energy transferred per unit of charge. We can insert these definitions into the equation for power:

$$\text{power} = \dfrac{\text dU}{\text dt} = \dfrac{\text dU}{\text dq} \cdot \dfrac{\text dq}{\text dt} = v \,i$$

Electrical power is the product of voltage times current. in units of watts.
