# Transcripts vs. Captions vs. Subtitles

# Transcripts

Transcripts are plain text and there is no time information attached to it.

Transcripts are presented in a separate document, whether it is a text file, word processing document, PDF, or web page.

# Captions

Captioning is a process that involves dividing transcript text into chucks, known as “**caption frames**,” and **time-coding** each frame to synchronize with the audio of a video. The output of captioning are captions.

Captions assume that the viewer cannot hear the video at all and must account for any sound that is not visually apparent, such as speech and sound effects, as well as speakers identification.

# Subtitles

Subtitles assume an audience can hear the audio, but need the dialogue provided in text form as well possibly because he or she can't understand the language. Therefore subtitles are usually associated with translation.
