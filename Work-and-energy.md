# Work and energy

# What is work and energy?

## Work

Work is the product of force and displacement.

## Energy

Energy is a measurement of the ability of something to do work.

### Examples

- A speeding bullet has a measurable amount of energy associated with it; this is known as **kinetic energy**. The bullet gained this energy because work was done on it by a charge of gunpowder which lost some chemical potential energy in the process.
- A hot cup of coffee has a measurable amount of **thermal energy** which it acquired via work done by a microwave oven, which in turn took electrical energy from the electrical grid.

## Efficiency

A traditional light bulb is only about 3% efficient at converting electrical energy to visible light, while a human being is about 25% efficient at converting chemical energy from food into work.

# How do we measure energy and work?

## Joule

The standard unit used to measure energy and work done in physics is theÂ **joule**, which has the symbol J. In mechanics, 1 joule is the energy transferred when a force of 1 Newton is applied to an object and moves it through a distance of 1 meter.

## **Calorie**

The amount of energy in an item of food is often written in **Calories** on the back of the packet. A typical 60 gram chocolate bar for example contains about 280 Calories of energy. One Calorie is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kg of water by 1 degree Celsius.

This is equal to 4184 joules per Calorie, so one chocolate bar has 1.17 million joules or 1.17 MJ of stored energy. That's a lot of joules!

The calorie, written with a lowercase c, is the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degrees Celsius.
The Calorie, written with a capital C, is the amount of energy required to raise 1 kilogram of water by 1 degrees Celsius.
So, it takes one thousand "little c" calories to equal one "big C" Calorie.

1 kcal = 1 Cal = 1000 cal.
